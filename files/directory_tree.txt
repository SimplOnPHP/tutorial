Php is only used by VSCode php extension, is not needed by the project.
At the project root "D:\1 SIMPLON" there is the docker-compose.yml file to create a contenirized dev enviroment.
The dev enviroment consists of three containers Apache, mysql and phpmyadmin.
The frameworks code is at simplon-php.
mysql_data_linux and mysql_data contain DB data two separate ones where required because of issues with OS interpretation of caps generated fails in the system otherwise.
htdocs has the files to be publicly published by the server, each subdirectory is intended to be a separate system.
	blank is intended as a template to copy, paste and rename.
	tutorial has a finshed version of the code of tutorial.

 
I want to upload a whole version of "D:\1 SIMPLON" to https://github.com/SimplOnPHP/quickStart So that anyone surfing https://simplonphp.org/quickStart.html can clone it run docker-compose up --build -d and start coding or following the tutorial https://simplonphp.org/tutorial.html.
